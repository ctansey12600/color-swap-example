# Color Swap Example

This repository is create to demonstrate an implication of [styled-components][0] into React. This application creates a card component that alternates background color. This is accomplished by alternating color based on the value of the id. If the value is even, the color will appear as one color while if the value is odd, the color will be another. This creates an alternation of card colors based on imported data.

This idea was applied in my Phase 2 Project for Flatiron school, or my website development and graphic design portfolio. Within the web development section, there are cards that are rendered to show examples of projects that have been created. However, I wanted the card color to alternate and up date while also keeping in line with the dark/light color scheme. By applying this logic I was able to create this alternating pattern of color.
